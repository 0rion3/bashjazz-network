FORKING
-------
If you decide to fork the repository and publish it some place else, it would
be of great help if you kept the original DONATION messages. Your help in this
regard - not removing the donation info - would be greatly appreciated - not
just by the project maintainers, but public at large who depend on this project
currently or may depend on it in the future. Thank you.

---------
Simply send donations to this BTC address: bc1qjk3t2hzrwnnx7qpp8u9utrjpzfv79h3k92p9gv
